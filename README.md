# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an application that will generate a random password based on criteria that is selected. This solves a problem of having to come up with a secure complex password yourself.

To use the random password generator you go onto the webpage, click generate password, you will then be asked a few different criteria's on which the password will be created using. Once all options have been selected a random password will be generated in the "Your secure password" box.
