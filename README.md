# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for this project was to feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, and also Day.js library, to create a calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day. This solves a problem of having remembering events and keeps all saved events on the webpage. This webpage also have the current date at the top of the page.

## Usage

This webpage can be used to save events in hourly time blocks. To use the work day scheduler you can go onto the webpage, click into any of the time blocks and you will be able to type the event for that hour. When you are happy with the event typed in, click the save button to the right of that hour to save it, now even if the page is refreshed you've saved event will stay in the dedicated time block.
